## Agro-Mastermind

### ABSTRACT:
<p align='justify'>As agriculture plays a crucial role in economic growth and food security of agro-based country, selection of crop(s) is an important issue for agriculture planning. It depends on various parameters such as weather condition, soil property and government policies. The proposed system aims at predicting or forecasting the crop yield by learning the past data related to farming. The suggested system helps the farmers to select suitable crop based on season and region of sowing. It will in-turn help the farmers by improving the net profit to them. By considering various factors such as soil conditions, humidity, slope, rainfall, temperature, the system builds a predicting model using one of the pattern matching technique. It will attain the crop prediction with best accurate value. It is very useful to predict the yield of the crop in agriculture sector. The system builds a model or method using which we can suggest list of crops which is mainly helpful for the farmers in his/her decision making.
  
A web application was developed for the farmers to get the crop information. This website is responsive in nature, so that farmers can easily use the website with the help of mobile or laptop. By these farmers can cultivate more crop and increase production ratio. The main awareness of this work is focused on Indian farmers of the Karnataka state. This will effectively help the farmers to get more information about the crops, and thereby cultivate the crops that is suitable for that region and season. 

This project was presented at the International Conference on Computing System and its Applications (ICCSA-2021) by me as part of a team of four. My primary contribution was working on the backend, where I focused on building the model using Python. The research paper was published in ScienceDirect and can be accessed [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666285X21000881).</p>

### SKILLS USED:
- Python, HTML, PHP, SQL
- Spider, MySQL, Xampp

### RESULTS:
- Successfully led a team to build a crop prediction website for Karnataka farmers, utilizing Python and MySQL for backend systems. 
- Reached 95% model accuracy for region and season-specific recommendations.
